## Save with Versioning - Blender Add-on

### Description
The "Save with Versioning" Blender add-on provides a convenient way to save your Blender files with automatic versioning and publishing functionality. This add-on helps you keep track of your project's progress and easily share the latest version with your team or clients.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Versioning**: The add-on automatically increments the version number in the file name when you save your Blender file, making it easy to keep track of changes.
- **Publish Functionality**: The published version of the file will always be the newest, up-to-date version. This allows you to link assets to the published file, while you can continue working on different incremental versions.
- **Automatic Asset Linking**: When you publish the current file, all the files that are linked to the published version will automatically get the updated version.
- **Customizable Suffixes**: You can customize the version suffix and publish suffix in the add-on preferences.

### Installation
1. Download the add-on script (e.g., `save_with_versioning.py`) from the provided source code.
2. In Blender, go to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Add-ons` > `Install`.
3. Select the downloaded `save_with_versioning.py` file and click "Install Add-on".
4. Enable the "Save with Versioning" add-on in the list of installed add-ons.

### Usage
1. **Save Increment**: Save the current file with an incremented version number.
2. **Save Publish**: Save the current file as the published version, which will be the newest, up-to-date version. Any files linked to the published version will automatically update.

### Addon Preferences
You can customize the add-on's behavior by accessing the "Save with Versioning" preferences:
- **Version Suffix**: Specify the suffix used for the incremented version numbers.
- **Publish Suffix**: Specify the suffix used for the published file.
